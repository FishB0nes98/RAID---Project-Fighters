## Patch 0.1.1 - School Characters Cooldown Balancing
*Released: [Current Date]*

### Character Balance Changes

This patch addresses cooldown issues with several school characters who were underperforming due to high ability cooldowns.

#### 🛡️ Schoolboy Siegfried
**Rationale**: Siegfried was struggling with long defensive cooldowns, making him less viable in sustained fights.

- **Lion Protection (W)**: Cooldown reduced from 15 → 10 turns
- **Sword Blessing (E)**: Cooldown reduced from 12 → 9 turns  
- **Judgement (R)**: Cooldown reduced from 25 → 15 turns

#### 💚 Schoolgirl Kokoro
**Rationale**: As a primary healer/support, Kokoro's abilities were too infrequent to provide consistent team support.

- **Silencing Ring (W)**: Cooldown reduced from 15 → 9 turns
- **Circle Heal (E)**: Cooldown reduced from 9 → 8 turns
- **Protective Aura (R)**: Cooldown reduced from 20 → 16 turns

#### 🦋 Schoolgirl Ayane  
**Rationale**: Ayane's utility and damage abilities were not available frequently enough to maintain her intended role as a mobile damage dealer.

- **Butterfly Trail (W)**: Cooldown reduced from 10 → 9 turns
- **Quick Reflexes (E)**: Cooldown reduced from 12 → 11 turns
- **Execute Attack (R)**: Cooldown reduced from 20 → 15 turns

#### 💕 Schoolgirl Elphelt
**Rationale**: Elphelt's longer cooldowns prevented her from effectively controlling enemies and dealing consistent damage.

- **Affection (E)**: Cooldown reduced from 12 → 9 turns
- **Piercing Bullet (R)**: Cooldown reduced from 22 → 14 turns

#### ⚾ Schoolboy Shoma
**Rationale**: Shoma's utility abilities needed to be more accessible, and Heavy Ball needed to be more impactful.

- **Catch! (E)**: Cooldown reduced from 11 → 9 turns
- **Heavy Ball**: Debuff duration increased from 2 → 4 turns
  - *The Heavy Ball now applies damage reduction for 4 turns instead of 2, making it more strategically valuable*

### Developer Notes

These changes are designed to improve the viability of school faction characters in both story mode and single stages. The reduced cooldowns should allow players to use these characters' signature abilities more frequently, leading to more engaging and dynamic gameplay patterns.

The Heavy Ball buff specifically addresses feedback that the debuff duration was too short to be meaningful in longer encounters.

### Technical Changes

- Updated ability cooldowns in character JSON files
- Modified Heavy Ball debuff duration and description text
- Updated ball selection UI to reflect new Heavy Ball duration
