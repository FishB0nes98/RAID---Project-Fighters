## Implementation Details

### Butterfly Healing (T12)
- Triggers on every dodge
- Heals for exactly 175 HP
- Respects max HP cap (won't overheal)
- Displays green healing text with sparkle animation
- Logs healing event to combat log

### Butterfly Stealth (T13)
- 50% chance to trigger on dodge
- Uses same stealth mechanics as Infernal Ibuki's Shadow Veil
- Applies untargetable buff for 1 turn
- Adds shadow/smoke visual effects
- Properly cleans up visual effects when buff expires
- Logs stealth activation to combat log

### Stealth Mechanics
The stealth implementation uses the same system as Infernal Ibuki:
- Creates untargetable buff with 1-turn duration
- Applies shadow visual effects (.shadow-step-active class)
- Adds smoke particle effects
- Automatically removes effects when buff expires
- Prevents targeting by enemy abilities

### Talent Tree Connectivity
- Both talents connect as children of Butterfly Protection (T11)
- Positioned below Butterfly Protection in the talent tree
- T12 (Healing) positioned at (1050, 930)
- T13 (Stealth) positioned at (1330, 930)

## Testing
Use the test file `test-schoolgirl-ayane-new-talents.html` to verify:
- Talent data loads correctly
- Effects trigger properly
- Passive integration works
- Visual effects display correctly

## Integration Notes
- Both talents integrate seamlessly with existing passive system
- No conflicts with existing talent effects
- Maintains consistency with other character talents
- Uses established visual effect patterns
- Proper cleanup of temporary effects
