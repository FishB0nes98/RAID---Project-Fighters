# Bridget Required Icons

The following icons need to be created for Bridget's abilities:

1. `water_essence.png` - Icon for Bridget's passive ability "Aqua Life Essence"
2. `water_cascade.png` - Icon for Bridget's Q ability "Ribbon Wave Rush"
3. `water_essence_enhanced.png` - Icon for Bridget's talent "Enhanced Life Essence"
4. `water_cascade_enhanced.png` - Icon for Bridget's talent "Ribbon Wave Power"
5. `healing_wave.png` - Icon for Bridget's talent "Soothing Waters"

These should be placed in the Icons/abilities/ directory. 

## Style Guidelines

The icons should use a blue/teal water-themed color palette with vibrant, magical visual elements that match Bridget's Tokyo Mew Mew-inspired character design.

## Notes

This is a placeholder file. The actual icons need to be created and added to the game for full visual implementation.
